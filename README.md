# Reflection:
## 1. Identify any challenges or issues you encountered while writing your functions.
-Ensuring the functions perform as intended and handle edge cases properly.
-Deciding on appropriate function signatures and parameters to make the functions versatile yet focused.
-Managing dependencies between functions and ensuring they interact correctly.

## 2. Discuss the benefits and challenges of developing and using unit tests.
## Benefits:
-Error Detection: Unit tests help identify errors or bugs early in the development process, making debugging easier.
-Code Quality: Writing unit tests encourages writing modular, well-structured code, leading to better code quality.
-Regression Testing: Unit tests provide a safety net when making changes to the codebase, ensuring existing functionality is not inadvertently broken.
-Documentation: Unit tests serve as documentation for how functions are intended to be used, aiding in understanding the codebase.
## Challenges:
--Time-Consuming: Writing and maintaining unit tests can be time-consuming, especially for complex systems or large codebases.
Mocking Dependencies: Testing functions that rely on external dependencies or resources often requires mocking, which can be challenging to set up correctly.
Test Coverage: Achieving comprehensive test coverage can be difficult, leading to gaps in testing that may leave areas of the code vulnerable to bugs.
Test Maintenance: As the code evolves, unit tests may require frequent updates to reflect changes, which can add overhead to development efforts.
